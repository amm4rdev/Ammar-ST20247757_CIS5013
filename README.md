https://github.com/amm4rdev/Ammar-ST20247757_CIS5013.git 
the reason why i have only 3 commits is because i ran into problems with the first repo i was working on it did has lfs added but everytime i made changes to my code as in implementing a new feature i kept getting a your repo has been hung unexpectdely and i wasnt too sure how to go about fixing it so i decided to finish everything and make a time management sheet to show what i did on the certain days as 
a github version control.

brought in textures and tried implementng textures 18/12/2023

brought in all obj assets in to scene and changed them from line to mesh by commenting out cull 18/12/2023

edited camera to get to topdown view 20/12/2023

added terrain in and got that working with the multiple lighting. 21/12/2023

changed the lighting and fixed a problem i had with the hut asset not spawning in 24/12/2023

attempeting isometreic camera view but also got texturing working so it loads on 1 mesh 27/12/2023

removed the isometric camera test and went back to top down as i found it too difficult 27/12/2023

got the meshes with displaying normal map and texures being the base colour map 29/12/2023

changed the assets translation matrixs to what im going for my level and keep the position of them to. 29/12/2023

i need to fix lighting so i decided to find a way to have lighting always on and it kept it to the middle of the map on the player character. 04/01/2024

 i have added terrain normal map i have got it to load in the base terrain and the normal map to the terrain and base colour map and it all loads in nicely. 04/1/2024
 
had a go at looking into transparency added in my asset made it transparent but its not loading properly im not too sure but its in fine 06/01/2024

i decided to remove the transparency as i couldnt get it to fully work im working on interaction instead 06/01/2024

i have looked into interaction but i cant get it to work because with pauls hes got when the beast goes through the cylinder it intracts and changes colour going a little red. 06/01/2024

i have tried to implement it but with my movement being jumpin on the spot it cant find a way to add interaction in only if the pillar overlapped the player character but it would look good so i decided i will come back to it. 06/01/2024
