readme 
here is is a gitclone link incase you have any problems with the github repo link in the closing kit but it should be fine i have tested it a couple time to see if it works.
https://github.com/amm4rdev/Ammar-ST20247757_CIS5013.git 
the reason why i have only 3 commits is because i ran into problems with the first repo i was working on it did has lfs added but everytime i made changes to my code as in implementing a new feature i kept getting a your repo has been hung unexpectdely and i wasnt too sure how to go about fixing it so i decided to finish everything and make a time management sheet to show what i did on the certain days as 
a github version control.
